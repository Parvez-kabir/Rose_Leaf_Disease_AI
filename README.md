## 📌 Project Overview

Early detection of plant leaf diseases is essential for improving crop yield and reducing economic loss. Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone. This project proposes an **AI-powered rose leaf disease detection system** that classifies leaf images into multiple disease categories with high accuracy while remaining lightweight enough for real-world deployment.

The system combines:

* A **lightweight CNN model (MobileNetV2)**
* A **modern web interface (HTML + CSS)**
* A **FastAPI backend** for real-time inference
* **Hugging Face deployment** for accessibility

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect rose leaf diseases automatically from images
* Maintain high accuracy with low model size
* Enable real-time inference via a web interface
* Ensure easy deployment and scalability

---

## 🧠 Dataset Details

* **Total Images:** 2,457
* **Source:** Collected from *Savar, Gilap Gram*
* **Number of Classes:** 5

### 🌿 Class Names

1. Healthy Leaf
2. Black Spot
3. Downy Mildew
4. Dry Leaf
5. Insect Hole

## 🏗️ Model Architecture & Selection

Multiple lightweight CNN models were evaluated:

* ResNet18
* MobileNetV2
* ShuffleNet
* SqueezeNet
* EfficientNetB0

### ✅ Why MobileNetV2?

MobileNetV2 was selected due to its **optimal balance between performance and efficiency**.

**Performance Metrics:**

* **Test Accuracy:** 98.17%
* **Precision:** 98.34%
* **Recall:** 98.17%
* **F1-score:** 98.15%

**Model Complexity:**

* **Parameters:** 2.23 million
* **Model Size:** 8.64 MB

This makes MobileNetV2 ideal for deployment on resource-constrained environments.
